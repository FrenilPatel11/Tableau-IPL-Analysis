# Tableau-IPL-Analysis

Here we have 2 datasets from ipl 2008-2020 and from this we have to get different insights like:
Orange and purple cap, Mvp of tournament,Winning based on toss,Total runs for each player,All batsman stats,Most wickets , All bowlers stats ,etc.

Using Tableau we can provide all this insights in the form of different graphs and tables on a single dashboard with the filters
